# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to clean, transform and analyze data to make informed business decisions. This project seek mainly to make a customer behaviour analysis in terms of their eshopping patterns relating to the time they spend online, their preferred product category and the amount of money they spend.



## Process
### Step 1
First, download the csv files. Secondly,  create tables in Pgadmin. Then import data from the csv files into the tables. 


### Step 2
Examine the data set as a whole to understand the meaning of each column and the relationship between them. Check for completeness and limitations.
### step 3
Clean the data by removing complete null columns, duplicate columns and, filling in missing values wherever possible.

### Step 4
Format column to their right data types such as time and decimals.

### Step 5 
Start with questions which help in providing some structure to the data analysis process. Questions also better define the purpose and direction of the analysis in order to extract meaningful information.

### Step 6 
Formulate my own questions to better understand the data and how they relate among tables.



## Results
There is a pattern concerning the Home/product category which many countries and cities share. The ecommerce platform is very popular among Americans and the amount of time spent onsite has a direct relationship with revenue generated.


## Challenges 

1.The data set have many unfamiliar terms which made it difficult to understand at the begining.
2.The data contain many null values.
3.The analytics table has a quite large volume of data amounting to over 4 millions rows, which makes it difficult to asses the output of a query
4.Due to the large volume of data pgadmin crashes multiple times.
5.It took quite some time to come to understand with the data set as certain columns look very similar in different tables
6. There are certain information which do not give enough indication about their purpose or relationships to other columns

## Future Goals
If given the time, I would like to make more deeper analysis by effectively manipulating the different tables with the help of more complex SQL queries.
